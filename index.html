        <p>
          Welcome to harrypotterGPT! This projects implements a mini GPT model
          that can write infinite Harry Potter. It's a project focused on
          natural language processing and generative AI. The models are trained
          on a coherent dataset containing all of the
          <a

            href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moxxis/harry-potter-lstm"
            >Harry Potter books</a
          >. This allows the model to output more Harry Potter inspired text.
          Although most language models are implemented as autoregressive models
          on the word, or subwords, level, I decided to implement this on a
          character based level for the sake of simplicity. Thus, the models
          generates one character at a time in an autoregressive fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a baseline model, I implemented the simplest of language models,
          the Bigram model. It makes predictions by only looking at the most
          recent character. It is extremely bad at generating sensible text
          since it has no knowledge of the characters beyond the preceeding
          letter. The output of the Bigram model is below:

        <p>
          As the main model, I implemented a decoder transformer model based on
          the famous research paper
          <a class="link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762"
            >"Attention is All You Need"</a
          >
          from 2017. The model has the same architecture as the decoder block
          presented in the paper. The model has just over 10.7M parameters and
          is trained on roughly 6 million tokens. For comparison, GPT-3 has 175
          billion parameters and was trained on 300 billion tokens. By simply
          looking at the output below, it might seem reasonable. However, when
          you start reading it you'll see that it doesn't make much sense. I
          believe this is a consequence of the simplicity of the model and the
          scarce dataset. I would be able to train a more complex network if I
          had more computing power.
